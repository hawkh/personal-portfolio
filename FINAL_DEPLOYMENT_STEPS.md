## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

After deployment, run these checks:

### 1. Quick Validation
```bash
# Run all deployment tests
npm run test:deployment

# Verify configuration
npm run verify
```

### 2. Live Site Testing

Visit your live site and verify:

- [ ] **Homepage loads** without errors
- [ ] **All sections work**: About, Experience, Projects, Skills, Contact
- [ ] **Resume downloads** correctly
- [ ] **Navigation works** on mobile and desktop
- [ ] **Animations function** properly
- [ ] **Social links** open correctly
- [ ] **Responsive design** works on different screen sizes

### 3. SEO Validation

- [ ] Test social media sharing (LinkedIn, Twitter)
- [ ] Verify site appears in search results (may take time)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs**:
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Click on the failed workflow
   - Review the error messages

2. **Common fixes**:
   ```bash
   # Fix TypeScript errors
   npm run type-check
   
   # Fix linting issues
   npm run lint:fix
   
   # Test build locally
   npm run build:production
   ```

3. **Re-run deployment**:
   - Fix any issues
   - Commit and push changes
   - Workflow will automatically re-run

### If Site Doesn't Load

1. **Check GitHub Pages settings**:
   - Ensure source is set to "GitHub Actions"
   - Verify repository is public

2. **Check workflow completion**:
   - Ensure the workflow completed successfully
   - Look for any error messages

3. **Wait for propagation**:
   - Sometimes takes a few minutes for changes to appear
   - Try clearing browser cache
